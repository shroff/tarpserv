============
INTRODUCTION
============

tarpserv is a lightweight extensible DHCP server. It was initially created
to distribute tarp tickets along with DHCP leases in order to mitigate
ARP cache poisoning attacks. This technique is based on the 2005 ACSAC paper
by Wesam Lootah, William Enck, and Patrick McDaniel.

Tarpserv is meant to be completely backward compatible with DHCP. It sends an
extra option with code 240 (typcially reserved for private use) to send the
ticket. If the ticket exceeds the maximum of 255 bytes allowed in one option, it
is split into multiple consecutive options. tarpclient receives the packet,
scans for option code 240, and use the contents of that packet to write out to
the ticket file.

tarpserv uses pcap to listen to and inject raw packets on the network.

============
INSTALLATION
============

tarpserv makes use of the openssl and pcap to carry out its functions. These
libraries must be installed (with develpment headers) in order to be able to
compile tarpserv. Additionally, it also requires a properly functioning tarp
installation on client computers, otherwise it will not provide any additional
functionality.


===============
VULNERABILITIES
===============

tarpserv relies on tarp to provide the actual functionality of protection
against ARP cache poisoning. Though the ticket exchange may not be vulnerable to
those, any vulnerabilities found in tarpe would lessen the integrity of the
network anyway.

Additionally, tarpserv may be vulnerable to DoS attacks. The server generates a
new ticket for each request, and does not cache it. You could limit this in one
of two way:

1. You could rate-limit packets from certain hardware sources

2. You could cache the ticket when you send out the lease so that you do not
have to re-generate it for the same host frequently.


===========
LIMITATIONS
===========

In it's current state, tarpserv is fairly limited in its configurability. It
does not allow for a lot of options, all of which are hard-coded. Adding more
options is just a matter of parsing a configuration file which was not the
primary focus as of right now.
